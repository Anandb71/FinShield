Finsight is an autonomous auditing system that uses a **Forensic Knowledge Graph** to detect fraud, verify payments, and uncover hidden conflicts of interest across thousands of documents.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Investigation Board (The Graph)
No more lists. Visualize your financial network.
- **Interactive Graph**: Navigate Invoices (Blue), Vendors (Yellow), and Risks (Red).
- **Conflict Hunter**: Automatically detects shared addresses/phones between Vendors and Employees.
- **Time Travel**: Filter the graph timeline with a slider.

### 2. X-Ray Reconciliation
Verify if an invoice was *actually* paid.
- **Smart Match**: Auto-links Invoices to Bank Transactions (Exact & Fuzzy Matching).
- **Ghost Detection**: Flags "Ghost Invoices" (No payment found).
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: "Force Match" logic feeds the learning loop.

### 3. Visual Nervous System
- **Deep Document Understanding**: X-Ray overlays for Tables, Entities, and Anomalies.
- **Consistency Engine**: Checks historical patterns (e.g., "Invoice amount is 20% higher than average").
