# Aegis (FinShield) 🛡️

> **AI-Powered Financial Document Forensics Platform — Built at DevSoc '26**

Aegis is an autonomous forensic auditing system built during the **DevSoc '26 hackathon** for the **Hotfoot sponsor track** (with **Backboard** as the AI/RAG sponsor). It ingests financial documents (bank statements, invoices, payslips, images), detects fraud using forensic mathematics (Benford's Law, balance integrity verification), and visualizes entity relationships through an interactive knowledge graph.

**Hotfoot** provided the challenge track and the financial document datasets. When the official dataset was **changed mid-hackathon from images to Excel spreadsheets**, we adapted our pipeline to handle both — our system processes PDFs, images (via OCR), and Excel files through the same unified analysis engine.

## 🚀 Key Features

### Fraud Detection Engine
- **Metadata Integrity Check** — Compares header/summary balances against calculated transaction balances. Catches "lying headers" where the closing balance has been tampered with (e.g. injecting a -61M balance into a statement that actually closes at ₹61).
- **Benford's Law Analysis** — Flags unnatural leading-digit distributions in transaction amounts.
- **Structuring / Smurfing Detection** — Identifies clusters of transactions just below reporting thresholds.
- **Round-Number Syndrome** — Detects suspiciously high ratios of round-number transactions.
- **Date-Sequence Violations** — Catches out-of-order or impossible date progressions.
- **Balance Continuity Checks** — Verifies running balance consistency across every row.

### Lie Detector Panel
- Dynamic integrity display on the Review page — shows **INTEGRITY FAILURE** (red) or **INTEGRITY VERIFIED** (green) based on real-time comparison of reported vs calculated balances.
- 3-priority fallback: backend `metadata_discrepancy` → anomaly structured fields → local transaction comparison.
- Zero hardcoded values — all thresholds computed from actual data.

### Excel Normalization ("The Repair Shop")
- Parses messy bank statement spreadsheets from any bank layout.
- Auto-detects header rows, column mappings, date formats.
- Repairs OCR artifacts, skips junk rows, handles merged cells.
- Extracts opening/closing balances from summary sections.
- Infers transaction types (debit/credit) from signed amounts.

### Investigation Board (Knowledge Graph)
- **Interactive 3D Graph** — Navigate documents, entities, and risk nodes.
- **Conflict Hunter** — Detects shared addresses/phones between vendors and employees.
- **Entity Resolution** — Links accounts, names, and references across documents.

### X-Ray Reconciliation
- **Smart Match** — Auto-links invoices to bank transactions (exact & fuzzy).
- **Ghost Detection** — Flags invoices with no matching payment.
- **Human-in-the-Loop** — Force-match decisions feed the learning loop.

## � Project Evolution

### Before Review 1 (Feb 8, 2026)

**Original Vision**: FinShield was initially built as **"The Financial Flight Recorder"** — an autonomous, real-time defense system for mobile users. We attempted to solve **two Hotfoot sponsor track challenges** simultaneously at **DevSoc '26**:

1. **Call Shield (Hotfoot Audio track)** — Real-time analysis of phone calls to detect urgency manipulation, fear tactics, and pressure techniques used by scammers. Used WebSocket streaming with a live risk meter.
2. **Contract Scanner (Hotfoot Docs + Backboard track)** — Instant detection of predatory clauses, hidden fees, and exploitative terms in financial documents, with cross-referencing via Backboard RAG.

> ⚠️ **Note**: Hotfoot's rules required teams to **pick only one track**. We initially tried both but pivoted to document intelligence after Review 1 (see below).

**Tech at this stage:**
- **Frontend**: Flutter with Riverpod state management, cybersecurity dark theme with neon accents, glassmorphism cards, animated shield logo, and a `call_shield_screen.dart` with a real-time risk meter
- **Backend**: FastAPI with mock service implementations for Hotfoot Audio (`audio_analyzer.py`), Hotfoot Docs (`document_scanner.py`), and Backboard RAG (`context_engine.py`)
- **Real-time pipeline**: WebSocket-based streaming (`sockets.py` + `ConnectionManager`) with `audio_processor.py` stub and `document_engine.py` stub
- **Architecture**: Monorepo with `/frontend` (Flutter) and `/backend` (FastAPI), Docker Compose for full-stack dev

### After Review 1 → Before Review 2 (Feb 9–10, 2026)

**The Pivot**: After Review 1 feedback and Hotfoot's requirement to **choose only one sponsor track**, we made a strategic decision to **drop the audio/call analysis track entirely** and go all-in on **document forensic intelligence**. The project evolved from a dual-challenge attempt into a focused, deep financial document auditing platform.

**Dataset curveball**: Midway through, Hotfoot **changed the official dataset from images (scanned documents) to Excel spreadsheets**. Rather than just switching, we built a pipeline that handles **both** — PDFs and images go through OCR + LLM extraction, while Excel files go through our custom normalization engine. This dual-format capability became one of our strongest differentiators.

**What changed and why:**

| What Changed | Why |
|---|---|
| **Dropped Hotfoot Audio** (deleted `audio_analyzer.py`, `audio_processor.py`, `call_shield_screen.dart`) | Hotfoot required picking one track. Document intelligence had deeper forensic potential. |
| **Flutter → React webapp** (new `/webapp` with React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Chakra UI) | Flutter was great for mobile but the use case shifted to a desktop-first investigator dashboard. React + Chakra UI enabled faster iteration on complex data-heavy UIs (tables, charts, graphs). |
| **Mock services → Real AI pipeline** (Backboard Assistant API integration with GPT-4o) | Replaced mock implementations with actual LLM-powered document classification, field extraction, and validation. |
| **Added forensic analysis suite** | Benford's Law, balance integrity checks, structuring detection, metadata fraud detection — none of this existed pre-review. |
| **Added Knowledge Graph** | Cross-document entity resolution with interactive force-directed visualization. Links accounts, vendors, and counterparties across uploaded documents. |
| **Added Excel Normalization Engine** | Parses messy bank statement spreadsheets from any bank layout — auto-detects headers, columns, date formats. |
| **Added Self-Learning Loop** | Human corrections feed back into the system. Error clustering, retraining triggers, continuous improvement. |
| **Rebranded to Aegis** | Reflected the evolved mission — from a "shield" to a full forensic auditing platform. |
